KisaanMitr: Empowering Farmers Through Technology

This project is my personal exploration of building a social impact solution using Flutter, Dart, GetX, and Firebase. KisaanMitr aims to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers, fostering a more equitable food system.

Key Technologies:

    Flutter: Delivering a native-like user experience across platforms with a single codebase.
    Dart: Leveraging a modern, object-oriented language for efficient app development.
    GetX: Maintaining a clean architecture and enhancing app navigation.
    Firebase: Ensuring secure authentication and robust data management for the application.

Features:

    Intuitive UI: Simple and user-friendly interface for both farmers and consumers.
    Effortless Buying & Selling: Streamlined functionalities to facilitate buying fresh produce directly from farmers and selling crops efficiently.
    Comparison Tool: Empower informed decisions with a price comparison feature.
    Secure Transactions: Firebase provides robust authentication to ensure user privacy and secure transactions.

A Work in Progress

KisaanMitr is an ongoing project that I'm actively developing and refining. Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute your ideas for further enhancements!
